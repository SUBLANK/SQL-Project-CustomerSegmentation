# SQL-Project-Customer Segmentation
## Customer Segmentation & Analysis Using SQL

## Overview
Examine customer spending patterns using SQL methods like window functions, joins, and CTEs to categorize customers by their spending habits. We'll utilize a customers table for basic details and a transactions table for purchase records to segment customers based on total spending and transaction frequency.

## Features:
- **Total Spending & Transactions Count**
- **Customer Classification (VIP, High Spender, etc.)**
- **Inactive Customer Detection**
- **Recency Analysis**
- **Ranking Customers Using Window Functions**

## How to Use:
1. Run `sample_data.sql` to create and populate the database.
2. Run `customer_segmentation.sql` to execute the analysis queries.
